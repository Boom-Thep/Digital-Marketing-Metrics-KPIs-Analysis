# Digital-Marketing-Metrics-KPIs-Analysis
## Project Summary
This project presents the dataset from Company XYZ's various digital marketing campaigns conducted over one month, spanning February 1st to February 28th. The campaign are set up by marketing team to attract more customer to the company's website. We are collaborating with the marketing team to assess the performance of these campaigns by analyzing the effectiveness of their spending, and measure the return on marketing investment. Our goal is to extract insights and provide recommendations to improve the performance of marketing team.

## About The Dataset and KPIs We will Focus On
### The datasets contain one table with a total of 11 column:
- id: Unique identifier for each entry
- campaign_date: Date of the campaign
- campaign_name: Name of the campaign (with a total of 11 distinct campaign name)
- category: Category of the campaign (e.g., social, search, influencer, media)
- campaign_id: Unique identifier for each campaign
- impressions: Number of impressions generated by the campaign
- marketing_spent: Amount spent on the campaign
- clicks: Number of clicks received
- leads: Number of leads generated
- orders: Number of orders made
- revenue: Revenue generated from the campaign

### The following are KPIs that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing campaign:
- **ROMI: Return on marketing investment**
- **CPC: Cost per clicks**
- **CPL: Cost per leads**
- **CAC: Customer acquisition cost (leads to orders)**
- **Gross Profit or Loss: revenue - marketing spent**

## Executive Summary
The analysis revealed that Company XYZâ€™s campaigns generated **$42.89M in revenue** with a **ROMI of 40.20%**, indicating efficient overall performance. The YouTube Blogger campaign emerged as the 
top performer with a **ROMI of 277%** and the highest **gross profit of $11.25M**, while Instagram campaigns (Blogger & Tier 1) also delivered strong results. However, several Facebook campaigns, particularly Facebook_lal, underperformed significantly with a negative **ROMI of -88.64% and a gross loss of $1M**, alongside Facebook_tier2 and Facebook_retargeting, which also showed negative ROMIs and gross losses. Influencer marketing proved to be the most effective campaign type, boasting a **ROMI of 154.29%**, while social media campaigns struggled with a negative **ROMI of -13.68%**.

To address these challenges, it is recommended to increase investment in high-performing campaigns like YouTube Blogger and Instagram, while restructuring or pausing underperforming Facebook campaigns to improve their effectiveness. Additionally, enhancing conversion rates for underperforming campaigns and optimizing resource allocation across campaigns will further boost ROI and improve overall efficiency.
