# Digital-Marketing-Metrics-KPIs-Analysis
## Project Summary
This project presents the dataset from Company XYZ's various digital marketing campaigns conducted over one month, spanning February 1st to February 28th. The campaign are set up by marketing team to attract more customer to the company's website. We are collaborating with the marketing team to assess the performance of these campaigns by analyzing the effectiveness of their spending, and measure the return on marketing investment. Our goal is to extract insights and provide recommendations to improve the performance of marketing team.

## About The Dataset and KPIs We will Focus On
### The datasets contain one table with a total of 11 column:
- id: Unique identifier for each entry
- campaign_date: Date of the campaign
- campaign_name: Name of the campaign (with a total of 11 distinct campaign name)
- category: Category of the campaign (e.g., social, search, influencer, media)
- campaign_id: Unique identifier for each campaign
- impressions: Number of impressions generated by the campaign
- marketing_spent: Amount spent on the campaign
- clicks: Number of clicks received
- leads: Number of leads generated
- orders: Number of orders made
- revenue: Revenue generated from the campaign

### The following are KPIs that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing campaign:
- **ROMI:** Return on marketing investment
- **CPC:** Cost per clicks
- **CPL:** Cost per leads
- **CAC:** Customer acquisition cost (leads to orders)
- **Gross Profit or Loss:** revenue - marketing spent

## Executive Summary
The analysis revealed that Company XYZâ€™s campaigns generated **$42.89M in revenue** with a **ROMI of 40.20%**, indicating efficient overall performance. The YouTube Blogger campaign emerged as the 
top performer with a **ROMI of 277%** and the highest **gross profit of $11.25M**, while Instagram campaigns (Blogger & Tier 1) also delivered strong results. However, several Facebook campaigns, particularly Facebook_lal, underperformed significantly with a negative **ROMI of -88.64% and a gross loss of $1M**, alongside Facebook_tier2 and Facebook_retargeting, which also showed negative ROMIs and gross losses. Influencer marketing proved to be the most effective campaign type, boasting a **ROMI of 154.29%**, while social media campaigns struggled with a negative **ROMI of -13.68%**.

To address these challenges, it is recommended to increase investment in high-performing campaigns like YouTube Blogger and Instagram, while restructuring or pausing underperforming Facebook campaigns to improve their effectiveness. Additionally, enhancing conversion rates for underperforming campaigns and optimizing resource allocation across campaigns will further boost ROI and improve overall efficiency.

### Campaign-Level ROMI Analysis

- **Performing Campaign:** Youtube_blogger has the **highest ROMI (277.32%) and gross-profit ($11.2 Million)**, indicating a significant return on investment along with Facebook_retargeting campaign strong positive **ROMI (101.50%)**. Therefore, resources should be allocated to a similar campaign like Youtube_blogger and Facebook_retargeting in the future. It is recommended to a marketing team to review these two campaigns and how are they different from other campaigns. 

- **Underperforming Campaigns:** Facebook_lal has the **lowest ROMI (-88.64%)**, indicating a significant loss on this campaign. Furthermore, both Facebook_tier 1 **(-6.57%)** and Facebook_tier2 **(-26.22%)** along with Instagram_tier2 **(-33.67%)** show negative ROMIs, suggesting that these campaigns are not generating sufficient revenue to cover their marketing costs. Moreover, three campaigns from Facebook generate a **significant amount of loss (approximately $3.7 Million)**. Therefore, the marketing team should minimize funds and marketing activity on the platform to review the strategy implemented on those channels. Find the underlying issues of of the ineffective results while comparing to more successful campaign from the same platform, Facebook_retargeting campaign.

### Campaign Type Effectiveness
- **Influencer Marketing:** Demonstrates a strong return on investment (154.29%) despite a high CPC ($11.07) and CPL ($490.31). Notably, this campaign type achieved the lowest CAC ($2,755.58) while yielding the highest ROMI. This likely stems from high total clicks (749,973) and a relatively high total leads (16,939), indicating influencer campaigns effectively drive traffic and generate leads. To optimize ROI, allocate more budget to influencer campaigns while reducing investment in less successful channels. Furthermore, the marketing team should implement strategies to increase the conversion rate from leads to orders (3014 orders from 16,939 leads).

- **Media:** Produced moderate results with 420,003 total clicks, 10,149 total leads, and 1566 total orders, demonstrating their effectiveness in driving traffic, generating leads, and producing orders. While the CPC ($11.97) and CPL ($495.29) are moderate, the CAC ($3209.88) is higher than influencer campaigns, indicating a higher cost per customer acquisition. Despite this, the campaign type still generated a moderate-to-high ROMI (22.41%), highlighting its effectiveness.
  
- **Search:** Generated the lowest total clicks (330,054), total leads (7107), and total orders (828), indicating weaker performance in driving traffic and generating leads. While the CPC ($10.48) and CPL ($486.90) are relatively low, suggesting lower costs for clicks and leads compared to influencer and media campaigns, the high CAC ($4179.23) indicates a significant cost to acquire customers. Due to these lower metrics, search campaigns generated a low ROMI (7.07), indicating a low return on investment.
  
- **Social:** Despite high total clicks (1,499,889) and total leads (31,384) with the lowest CPC ($9.20) and CPL ($439.67), suggesting effective social media campaigns in driving traffic and generating leads, the low conversion rate from leads to orders (2635 orders out of 31,384 leads) and the highest CAC ($5236.62) contribute to a negative ROMI (-13.68). The marketing team should conduct a thorough analysis of all social media campaigns, considering factors such as: Which platforms were used? Which platforms generate the highest order-to-lead ratios? Which platforms should be prioritized based on performance? Which locations (Tier 1 or Tier 2) demonstrate higher conversion rates? Which channels should have their budgets minimized or paused based on further review?

### Geolocation Targeting Analysis
- Tier 1 cities demonstrate significantly better performance with a total revenue of 6,940,536, a positive gross profit of 1,810,465.27, and a strong positive ROMI of 35.29%. This indicates that marketing efforts in Tier 1 cities are highly effective and profitable.
- Tier 2 cities show significantly lower performance with a total revenue of 4,133,766, a negative gross profit of -1,626,258.72, and a negative ROMI of -28.23%. This suggests that marketing efforts in Tier 2 cities are not generating sufficient revenue to cover the marketing costs, resulting in a loss.

**Recommendations:**
- Prioritize Tier 1 Cities: Continue to prioritize marketing efforts in Tier 1 cities, as they have shown strong performance and profitability.
- Re-evaluate Tier 2 Strategies:
  - Analyze and refine targeting criteria for Tier 2 cities.
  - Re-evaluate messaging and creative to better resonate with the target audience in Tier 2 cities.
  - Consider adjusting budgets and allocating more resources to Tier 1 cities.
